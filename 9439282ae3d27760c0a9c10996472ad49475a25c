      "message": "\u003e Does these existing have a practical problem I can come back to?\n\nMy issue is that they quickly become inaccurate, as code changes, and are in my opinion noise.  Nearly no files in the Linux kernel have such a flag.  I don\u0027t see why we should start adding them.\n\nAs part of the CLA you\u0027ve already given a copyright grant, including our ability to _relicense_ and _sublicense_ your code.\n\n```\nArguably I also should\u0027ve added\n// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright OpenBMC Authors\n```\n\nI\u0027ve seen this in a few places, but I\u0027m entirely unsure why.  A copyright is by the creator, which is a legal entity.  There is no such \"OpenBMC Authors\" as a legal entity so, in my eyes, any statement like that is entirely non-beneficial.\n\nIf we had to satisfy every company\u0027s arbitrary \"legal department\" requirements, I don\u0027t think we\u0027d make it anywhere as a project.  I really don\u0027t see it appropriate that your internal policies somehow trickle out into the project, at least not without any discussion.",
