I really don\u0027t see it appropriate that your internal policies somehow trickle out into the project, at least not without any discussion.\n\nI believe at least 3 of the primary CLA contributors at the time had similar arbitrary requirements, and if implementing it is trivial, it didn\u0027t seem worth the effort to go fight against it.  But clearly you think it\u0027s important, so I can at least go back for my current employer and understand the requirement before trying to impose it on the project contributions.  Someone will need to go back to the other copy-written files and see if removing that is ok.\n\nFWIW, the \"Copyright OpenBMC authors\" was done in line with what LF recommends here:\nhttps://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects\n\nTo try to keep these from going out of date and make them maintainable.  If we have other guidance from them, it would be great to surface it.\n\nFrom that article \"You should not change or remove someone else’s copyright notice unless they have expressly (in writing) permitted you to do so. This includes third parties’ notices in pre-existing code.\"\n\nLikely a code review comment approval meets that \"in writing\" requirement, but I need to verify.  I suspect it\u0027s probably easier if the remove the copyright come from me.\n\nThere was lots of discussion about these copyright headers long ago, and ultimately in the case of the a bunch of the intel contributions, the copyright notices were kept.  If we want to reopen that discussion, I\u0027m happy to do it, but I\u0027m not an expert.",
